# This is the podman executable for use with my vscode Remote-Containers extension
# This is needed because I use root podman which requires sudo before calling podman.
# Do not use this in the $PATH as it will interfere with the usual podman command
# To set patch, open settings with Ctrl-, search for Docker path and set value to this binary

sudo podman $@
